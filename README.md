- 👋 Hi, I’m @muhammadismailyunus
- 👀 I’m interested in Dynamical Systems, Chaotic Dynamics, Hamiltonian Systems, and Its Applications. Also really interested in the Geometrical Structures of Dynamical Systems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, AUTO-07P, Julia, C++, Fortran, Octave/Matlab, and R. Trying to understand MySQL.
- 💞️ I’m looking to discussion on Dynamical Systems, Chaotic Dynamics, and Hamiltonian Systems. Trying to learn Machine Learning, Data Science, or even Data Analysis for works purpose (heavily towards Python and Julia because it's more interesting and still trying to motivate myself to learn MySQL) 
- 📫 How to reach me muhammadismailyunus@gmail.com or mi.yunus_92@yahoo.com
